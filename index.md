## The Consortium for Agile Genomics (CAG) promotes implementation of an HL7 FHIR Genomics platform and provides project support, certification, expertise, and validation tools that help its members navigate, implement, and collaborate on challenges of genomic integration.  This will be achieved by leveraging FHIR-linked technologies to implementing genomics to solve problems in healthcare.
